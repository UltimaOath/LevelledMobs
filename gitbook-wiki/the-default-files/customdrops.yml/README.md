## Custom Drops Configuration

LevelledMobs' `customdrops.yml` file allows you to build custom drops utilizing many different config options to create unique materials and custom commands to add to or replace an entity's drops.

***

## Defaults:

These config options will apply to all drops constructed within CustomDrops _unless_ you have modified a drops' individual properties to override these default settings. Each of these must have a value in order for LM's CD to function properly, but once it is set here, you do not need to set it within your individual drops if the value would not change. These defaults apply to all systems within the CD file, including **Drop Tables**.

For example, if your permission was <code>levelledmobs.permission.vip</code>, you would configure it as such: <code>permission: ['vip']</code>. Using <code>overall_permission:</code> will apply to all items within the set, while <code>permission:</code> applies to each singular item.</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>cause-of-death:</code></td><td>A <code>MODALLIST</code> config option; this represents a check against how the entity was killed. This only takes into account the final blow, and will ignore <code>player-caused: true</code>, since the cause of death will not typically involve player interaction ('fire' dealing the damage, versus the player).</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>min-player-level:</code> <code>max-player-level:</code></td><td>This represents the minimum and maximum Minecraft level required of the Player before an individual CD will drop.<br>Replace with <code>-1</code> to disable this particular level check.</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>player-level-variable</code></td><td>If this config option is set, the above <code>min-player-level:</code> and <code>max-player-level:</code> will reference this variable instead of the player's Minecraft level. You can use any <code>PAPI</code> placeholder tag in this place similar to how the <code>Player Levelling</code> strategy uses the variable to generate levels.</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>player-level-match-value</code></td><td>If this config option is set, you can instead check for a text-based value from a a <code>PAPI</code> placeholder tag. This can still reference the above <code>min-player-level:</code> and <code>max-player-level:</code>. You can use any <code>PAPI</code> placeholder tag in this place similar to how the <code>Player Levelling</code> strategy uses the variable to generate levels. The tag will be checked against the <code>player-level-variable:</code>. This config option includes a wildcard ability to pull part of the output from the <code>player-level-variable:</code>. You can add a <code>*</code> as a prefix, suffix, or both to search for a partial match. For example, if the variable output was <code>Lvl 5 Zombie- S0hp</code>, I could search for <code>Zombie*</code> or <code>*Zombie*</code> to successfully match, as the word <code>Zombie</code> matches in part as a wildcard check. Under this example, searching for <code>Zombie</code> would fail to match, as the word in the output appears as <code>Zombie-</code> and the search parameters were for an exact-match.</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>external-amount</code></td><td>When used with LM Items Official Plugin, this sets the amount internally to the specified plugin</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>type</code></td><td>When used with LM Items Official Plugin, this sets the item type (currently only supported with MMOItems)</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>run-on-spawn</code></td><td>Applicable only to custom commands, determines if it will be executed when a mob spawns in</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>run-on-death</code></td><td>Applicable only to custom commands, determines if it will be executed when a mob dies</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><code>delay</code></td><td>Applicable only to custom commands, this is the number of ticks that will elapse before the command is executed</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Universal Groups:

LM includes several groups of entities which are bundled together in a convenient format. Each of these groups function as their own EntityType, applying to multiple entities at once. You can refer to the [EntityType Universal Groups](https://github.com/lokka30/LevelledMobs/wiki/Documentation---rules.yml#universal-mob-and-biome-groups) for the different types!

## Specified Mobs:

LM has listed all vanilla entities as of Minecraft 1.20 within the CD file. You should locate the entity you wish to modify instead of adding additional entities at other spots within the config, as they will most likely not process as expected. You may delete any entities you do not use if you so choose, as you can always add them back again later.

## Sliding Values

There are three options that support sliding values; `chance`, `equipped` and `overall_chance`. You can either use a decimal to represent a percent or assign tiers that represent a level range and an assignment range. The syntax is:

```yaml
chance:
  lvl-lvl: X-Y
```

On the left side you put the min and max levels that the tier can match, then on the right side put the min and max chance those level ranges will use; where the assigned value slides based on the level values assigned. If the mob level is between the min and max then it will use the assigned min and max assignment. For example:

```yaml
- IRON_SWORD:
    chance:
      1-10: 0.2-0.8
      11-20: 1.0
```

In the above example, level 1 mobs will have a 20% chance. Level 10 mobs will have 80% chance and any mob levels in between will scale accordingly. For mobs levelled 11 through 20, they will have a 100% chance. Any mob levels without an assignment will have 0% chance, such as level 21+ in the above example.

## Drop Tables

CD includes the Drop Table system, which allows you to construct groups of materials or custom commands which can be attached to any EntityType as a single line item utilizing `usedroptable: tableName`, helping to reduce any instances of duplicate drops covering multiple entities. This can also be used to craft 'tiered' drops.

```yaml
PUT_ENTITY_TYPE_HERE:
  - usedroptable: 'putTableNameHere'
```

When constructing drops with the Drop Table, you can replicate the same formatting used for any other drop, replacing the EntityType with the tableName.

**NOTE:** It is highly recommended that you instead use the **Rules** file to implement any drop table. It will provide far more accurate conditioning for when and how to apply drop tables.

## LM Items - External Plugin Support

If you want to use custom items from external plugins, take a look at LM Items.\
This plugin bridges the gap so you can use third party items natively.\
Download from [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lm-items.102081/](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lm-items.102081/)

An example of how LM Items improves your server: Adding Player Heads to mobs!

Here is an example of how to use the  `- HeadDatabase:` LM Items item-type.

```yaml
# Requires LM_Items Official Addon
  - HeadDatabase:61942:
      amount: 1
      chance: 1.0
```

You supply the skull ID number from [Minecraft Heads](https://minecraft-heads.com/), which is provided in the URL of the skull which you select, and append it to the `HeadDatabase:` item-type as shown above.\
For example, the url `https://minecraft-heads.com/custom-heads/humanoid/61942-demon-helmet` would have the ID `61942`.

## Materials, Commands, and Special Items

```yaml
- MATERIAL:

- ENCHANTED_BOOK:
    enchantments:
      ENCHANTMENT: X

- customCommand:
    command: ''
    command: ['', '']
    ranged_A: ''
    ranged_B: ''
    name: ''
```

`MATERIAL:` drops gather their config options from the Defaults section listed above. Any config option listed there can be used within any `MATERIAL:` or `customCommand` drop.

`customCommand:` tells CD that you wish to setup a command to process like any other drop.\
In order for this feature to function, it requires at minimum the `command:` config option with a valid console formatted command present.\
You can also use multiple commands at once by listing them as demonstrated above.\
An example of a valid command might be `effect give %player% strength %ranged_a% %ranged_b%`.\
The tags prefixed with `ranged_` are unique. These allow you to construct a random number generator to be used within commands as placeholders. The example config above demonstrates how you would utilize the ranged config option, appending an A/B/C/D, et cetera to the end of `ranged_` creates the tag, while the value represents a range of potential values which could be applied to the placeholder tag present in the individual command drop. Using the previous example command, with the `ranged_A: 1-2` and `ranged_B: 3-5`, then the first tag would be any value between 1-2, while the second would be any value between 3-5 when utilized within the command being activated.

`ENCHANTED_BOOK` is a special type of `MATERIAL` drop which will enable anvil-ready enchanted books by utilizing the `enchantments:` config option.
