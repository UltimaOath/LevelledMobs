# ðŸ¤Ÿ Donations

First of all, **THANK YOU** for expressing an interest in donating to the Developers, Maintainers, and Support Staff of LevelledMobs.

Together we have worked on this project on and off for several years. We have never charged for LevelledMobs in the past and we do not have plans to charge for it in the future.

We do all the work to maintain and support the plugin in our free time without any form of payment or return on the work beyond the fun of the hobby. We greatly appreciate any contribution already made to the plugin, from financial to code commits to feature suggestions and bug reports.\
All of this helped make LevelledMobs4 possible.

If you are able to support our developers and staff with a donation of any amount, it will help to maintain support for this long-running project even longer: The modest idea of a solo Australian; now balanced by a three-person-team juggling the highest rated, entirely free plugin on Spigot.

### **PenalBuffalo (aka stumper66)**

**LM2 - Developer & Contributor**\
**LM3 - Primary Developer & Support**\
**LM4 - Primary Developer & Support**

PenalBuffalo resurrected the project and release LM2 at a time when development looked like it would stop for good, adding in various groundbreaking features critical to our success today, such as the Custom Drops, Spawners, Summon, and more.\
PenalBuffalo has written the vast majority of LevelledMobs' code since LM2, and has taken the role of primary developer of the plugin since LM3, taking the resource from lokka30 in late 2023.\
Culminating with the current LM4, which was entirely rewritten by PenalBuffalo from the ground up through consultation with the original LevelledMobs author lokka30. He has supported thousands of users on our Discord with their questions and bug reports, and has developed their fantastic ideas to improve the plugin over many years.

### UltimaOath

**LM1 - Contributor, & Support**\
**LM2 - Tester, Contributor, & Support**\
**LM3 - Tester, Contributor, Wiki, & Support**\
**LM4 - Tester, Contributor, Wiki, & Support**

One of the first users of the original LevelledMobs1 plugin, UltimaOath believed that the plugin even in that earliest form was special and choose to stick around and offer support, advice, features, and more; even contributing the idea of crafting a modular rules system for LM3 . Not to mention around half of the features included in LevelledMobs are some variation of their dozens of feature submissions which have helped make LevelledMobs what it is today.\
Since LM3 they have been responsible for maintaining the Wiki, crafting the default configuration files, testing over four-hundred development builds, sorting out thousands of feature requests, questions, and the occasional bug report on the support Discord, and far more. Their contributions span every era of the entire project and are impossible to measure, providing and proving the premium quality that LevelledMobs presents to it's users.

### lokka30

**LM1 - Original Author, Primary Developer, Support**\
**LM2 - Original Author, Primary Developer, Support**\
**LM3 - Original Author, Developer, Support**\
**LM4 - Developer, Contributor, Support**

The original... the first... the creator of the LevelledMobs plugin.

Without their foundational work, none of this would be possible. lokka30 spearheaded the construction of the modular rules system to lift LevelledMobs to an entirely different level of power; the modular rules being the keystone of LM3 and LM4's development.&#x20;

Part way through the development cycle of LevelledMobs3, lokka30 had to step back from the primary developer reigns of the plugin to make way for their real-world education, leaving the plugin's resource page and it's future development to the capable hands of PenalBuffalo; though they haven't stepped away entirely. They contribute ideas, code commits, provide support and more through our Discord.&#x20;
