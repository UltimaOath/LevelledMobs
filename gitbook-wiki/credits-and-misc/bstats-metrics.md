# üìê bStats Metrics

![Live bStats Graph](https://bstats.org/signatures/bukkit/LevelledMobs.svg)

Our plugin, alongside thousands of others, use the reliable and highly trusted [bStats](https://bstats.org/getting-started) to gather very simplistic data about our plugin in order to better guide it's development. All data gathered by this third party is sent in an anonymous fashion through the same pool of data to form various graphs and tables of information, and no IP information so stored with this data.

All information requested is also available to review  publicly by clicking on the link below:

## If you really want to to opt-out anyway:

If you wish to not send your metrics then you may edit the `/plugins/bStats/config.yml` file appropriately and restart your server.
