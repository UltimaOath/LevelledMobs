# 🌏 Welcome

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important Notice**\
New Users to LevelledMobs 4 or;\
Users Migrating from LevelledMobs 3 -> 4\


**For LevelledMobs4, we highly recommend you test the plugin first on a testing server prior to applying to any live server.**

We would already recommend this behavior for any release of the plugin, but for users updating from **LM3** to **LM4** , or for anyone using **LM4** for the first time; we have spent over a year of development, with multiple entire rewrites, and had several months of testing, all prior to any public release. This effort means that even though **LevelledMobs3** and **LevelledMobs4** functions in a very similar way, they are in fact entirely different plugins. There may still be bugs or flaws which we have not encountered. For the first month or two of the public release of **LevelledMobs4** we cannot suggest more forcefully that you should **test this plugin on a testing server first** before you test or migrate the plugin to your live server.\


**For anyone migrating from LevelledMobs 3 -> LevelledMobs 4**, even though the configuration files are similar they are different enough that they will not be automatically translated over. We of course first suggest that you experience **LevelledMobs 4** as it is out-of-the-box and see if you want to incorporate these changes into your old setup. Second, if you want to retain your old setup, you could consult this wiki and the **LM3** wiki, and recreate your rules taking note of the changes in name and formatting of various settings.

## Do you need to update LevelledMobs?

Updating LevelledMobs4 is as easy as downloading the latest release of the plugin from one of the above download links and replacing the previous `.jar` file. No need to change your rules from one update to the next. In most cases, we are able to push updates to your configuration which would not break it's functionality, however there may be instances where we will recommend letting a new **Rules** file to generate or for you to reference the latest version to see any new features or interesting tweaks made.

The plugin itself will notify you once at server startup of any available update from Spigot or Hangar.&#x20;



## Got any questions?

First, we recommend checking out the Frequently Asked Questions section of this wiki, as your question may have already been asked and answered often enough to earn itself a place in the FAQ.

If your question isn't listed in the FAQ, then we suggest joining the official [ArcanePlugins Support Discord](https://discord.gg/arcaneplugins-752310043214479462). Here is where much of the support, development, and testing of LevelledMobs and all other ArcanePlugin works occurs. Locate the appropriate channel for your question and ask, ensuring you follow the rules established there such as not to ping the staff or act in a way that is considered inappropriate to the staff or users seeking support. \
