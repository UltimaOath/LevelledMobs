## Do you need to update LevelledMobs?

{% hint style="danger" %}
Important Notice\
Users Migrating from LevelledMobs 3 -> 4

Even though both plugins function in a mostly identical way, nearly all of the configuration option names have changed in some fashion. This means simply using the old configuration from LevelledMobs 3 will not work for 4. There are three options available to you:



1 ]   Using the wikis of both LM3 and LM4, compare how LM3 handled a configuration option and how LM4 handles it now. In most cases, simply changing the text of the config and leaving the formatting the same as before. We can also provide limited support with users experiencing issues converting their files.

2 ]   Perform a fresh install of LM4, and referencing your LM3 file, recreate your configuration in the new system. LM4 has several new default Custom Rules and settings which will be noticeably different than previous iterations of the plugin.&#x20;

3 ]   Simply run with a fresh install of LM4, and give the new defaults a test drive around the block before editing the file from scratch utilizing the many new features and abilities like multiple enabled strategies.
{% endhint %}



Updating LevelledMobs4 is as easy as downloading the latest release of the plugin from one of the above download links and replacing the previous `.jar` file. No need to change your rules from one update to the next. In most cases, we are able to push updates to your configuration which would not break it's functionality, however there may be instances where we will recommend letting a new **Rules** file to generate or for you to reference the latest version to see any new features or interesting tweaks made.
