# 🌏 Welcome

**Important Notice**\
New Users to LevelledMobs 4 or;\
Users Migrating from LevelledMobs 3 -> 4\


**For LevelledMobs 4, we highly recommend you test the plugin first on a testing server prior to applying to any live server. We are not responsible for you skipping this step.**

Even for a regular release of the plugin, we would recommend testing this plugin and any others together on a testing server first before you apply things in a live environment.

**LevelledMobs 4** functions in a similar way to **LevelledMobs 3**, and even the configuration files are fairly similar. However this plugin should be considered by everyone an entirely new plugin. Even though it has gone through over a year of development, with two entire re-writes, and several months of behind-the-scenes tweaking and testing, that does not mean that we have prevented or solved every possible issue.

For this first month or two of the plugins' release, we cannot suggest more forcefully that you should **test this plugin first on a testing server** before applying to your live server.



***



**For anyone migrating from LevelledMobs 3 -> LevelledMobs 4**\
**E**ven though the configuration files are similar they are different enough that they will not be automatically translated over as with previous versions of the plugin. Starting with the **LM 4** releases, subsequent migrations should work as previously.

Of course we first suggest that you experience **LevelledMobs 4** as it is out-of-the-box and see if you want to incorporate the many changes and new features into your old setup.

Second, if you want to retain your old setup, you could consult this wiki and the **LM 3** wiki, and recreate your rules taking note of the changes in name and formatting of various settings. For most files, it would take about five to ten minutes to convert over a file by hand.

If you are genuinely struggling to convert your **LM 3** installation to **LM 4**'s formatting, you can ask for assistance in the official Support Discord linked below. To be entirely plain, we are not going to redo your file for you; we will help point to where you've made mistakes in the conversion.

## Do you need to update LevelledMobs?

Updating LevelledMobs4 is as easy as downloading the latest release of the plugin from one of the above download links and replacing the previous `.jar` file. No need to change your rules from one update to the next. In most cases, we are able to push updates to your configuration which would not break it's functionality, however there may be instances where we will recommend letting a new **Rules** file to generate or for you to reference the latest version to see any new features or interesting tweaks made.

The plugin itself will notify you once at server startup of any available update from Spigot or Hangar.&#x20;
